I am a masters student completing my masters by research in bioinformatics at the university of Exeter, UK. My current area of study is in marine metagenomics and single-cell amplified genomes. 

I completed my undergraduate degree at the University of Exeter in 2015 acheiving a Bachelor of Science with Honours in Biological Sciences (Molecular and Cellular Biology). I am hoping to continue my studies in Exeter in the future. 

As a bioinformatician I am increasingly interested in ways computer science can be use in a biological context. I am looking at methods of answering biological questions with big datasets using computer algorithims.
