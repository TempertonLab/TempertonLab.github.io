I’m currently completing my PhD at the University of Exeter, researching the the co-evolutionary dynamics of SAR11, its viruses and their environment, with a particular focus on physical properties. I graduated from the University of Exeter in 2018, with a Bachelor of Science (hons) in Biological Sciences (Microbiology and Infectious Disease) and completed a MbyRes in 2019 researching the use of microfluidics in viral encapsulation for phage therapy.

I’m widely interested in using cutting-edge technologies to a.) better understand the ecology of marine microorganisms and b.) use this information to develop innovative solutions to current societal challenges.
