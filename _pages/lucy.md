I’m currently completing my Master’s by Research at the University of Exeter, researching phage encapsulation in alginate droplets, using microfluidics. I graduated from the University of Exeter in 2018, with a Bachelor of Science (hons) in Biological Sciences (Microbiology and Infectious Disease). I am also starting a PhD later this year at the University of Exeter, where I’ll be using microfluidics to study the co-evolutionary dynamics of SAR11, its viruses and their environment, with a particular focus on physical properties. 

I’m widely interested in using cutting-edge technologies to a.) better understand the ecology of marine microorganisms and b.) use this information to develop innovative solutions to current societal challenges.
