I graduated from Oregon State University in June 2018 with a Bachelor of Science in Microbiology with a minor in Chemistry. I worked in Dr. Stephen Giovannoni’s Marine Microbial Genomics and High Throughput Cultivation Lab as an Undergraduate Researcher (October 2014 – June 2018) and the Chief Organiser (October 2015 – June 2018). I studied the metabolism of SAR11 and the spatiotemporal distribution of SAR202.

I am currently a Graduate Research Assistant working on a time series  of the bacterial and viral populations in the West English Channel’s. I broadly am interested in the big puzzle of metabolism(s) in “weird” cells.
