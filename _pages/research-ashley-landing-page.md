## Hi!
If you made it here, this is my landing page for the various research projects I am part of.

## [Metagenomics of the Bermuda Atlantic Time Series (BATS)](/research/ashley/metagenomics)
This project consisted of looking at changes in marine bacterial populations over a diel cycle within a timeseries at Bermuda. Analysis consisted of the assembly of Metagenomic Assembled Genomes within the cellular fraction and genomics analysis.


## [SAR11 Single-cell Amplified Genomes (SAGs)](/research/ashley/sags)
451 SAR11 SAGs were isolated and sequenced. This project consisted of the genomic analysis of these SAGs.
