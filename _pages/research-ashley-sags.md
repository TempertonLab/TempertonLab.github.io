## Intro
With the world’s oceans covering roughly 70% of the earth surface; its impact on the global carbon cycle, climate change, and acid-base biochemistry remains crucial to our understand of the natural world. Considering 90% of the ocean’s biomass comprise of marine microorganisms; their impact on global systems remain largely understudied. Marine microorganisms are critical in the energy cycle and are the foundation for marine life. However, studying these microorganisms remains challenging with a small fraction being culturable for in situ experimentation. Alternative study methods include obtaining genomes via metagenomics studies and Single-cell Amplified Genomes. Both of these methods have advantages and drawbacks with marine metagenomes being highly complex to analyse and SAGs suffering from both low coverage and bias. This study aims to explore both approaches and provide improvements to aid analysis.

## Single-cell Amplified Genomes
Single-cell Amplified Genomes or SAGs for short are genomes isolated from single cells that are amplified using PCR technology and sequenced. This allows for isolated cells to be sequenced creating a pure sample. PCR is used in this method as organisms usually only have 1 to a few copies of their genomic DNA, which is not enough material for current sequenciong technlogy to produce a consensus of the organism genome. 


## SAR11 and its importance
Obtaining SAGs are highly applicable for SAR11, a marine organism that dominates the ocean's microbial biosphere. SAR11 is somewhat more difficult to culture, with long doubling times and needing to grow in a nutrient "broth" akin to its natural habitate, the open oceans. Being able to isolate such abundant organisms and obtain their sequences without specalist equipment and long growth times would be advantages in studying one of the most abundant organisms on this planet. 

## 451 SAR11 SAGs 
451 SAR11 SAGs were sequenced using short read illumina technology, assembled and displayed here. With a large amount of assemblies, genomic content was compared between organisms to look at differing gene content, phylogenetics and lysogenic viral content. Differing nucleotide content was performed via Average Nuclotide Identitiy (ANI) where nuclotide content in protein coding regions are compared. Phylogentics was done via Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) of protein coding regions as well as comparing 16S regions. [Viral signitures](/research/ashley/metagenomics/#global-abundance) were extracted from SAGs and its coding regions analysed. 

## Phylogenetic Tree
Below contains the 16S phylogentic tree of SAR11 SAGs containing 16S fragments. 16S sequences were compared and visualised in the form of a phylogenetic tree.

## Average Nuclotide Identity
ANI is the measurement of how different nuclotide composition of coding regions differ from each other. All SAR11 SAGs ANI was calculated between each other and visualised as a heatmap in the link below. Darker squares indicate a higher ANI or closer genetic identity to each other. Clusters of colours suggest differing populations.
