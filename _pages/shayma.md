I am currently a PhD student at the University of Exeter, focusing on developing genomic tools for field based screening of a globally important pathogen (ISKNV) in aquaculture. I completed my undergraduate course at Baghdad university studying Microbiology, followed by an MSc in Medical and  Molecular microbiology at the University of Manchester. I have recently completed an MbyRes at the University of Exeter, analysing microbial communities associated with tilapia aquaculture.

As a mother of two, I am greatly motivated to create healthy living conditions for families in rural areas, and the return of fisheries, with the possibility of using fish as a healthy, constant food staple.
