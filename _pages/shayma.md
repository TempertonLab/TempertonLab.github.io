I am currently a student at the University of Exeter completing my MbyRes; studying fish skin microbiomes, with a focus on finding alternative ways to reduce animal cruelty while sampling.

I completed my undergraduate course at Baghdad university studying Microbiology, followed by an MSc in medical molecular microbiology at the University of Manchester. I will be starting my PhD this September, 2019 in “Genomic tools for field based screening of globally important pathogens in aquaculture” at Exeter University.

As a mother of two, I am greatly motivated to create healthy living conditions for families in rural areas, and the return of fisheries, with the possibility of using fish as a healthy, constant food staple.
