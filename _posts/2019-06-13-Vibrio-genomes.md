excerpt: "*Vibrio parahaemolyticus* is the lead causative agent for seafood-borne human gastroenteritis. While its occurrence has traditionally been uncommon in Europe and the United Kingdom, rising sea surface temperatures have resulted in an increased prevalence. Here, we present the complete genome sequences of four novel *V. parahaemolyticus* strains isolated in the United Kingdom."
